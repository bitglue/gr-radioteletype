    By adding raised cosine filters at multiples of the sample rate we can

    By varying the order we are able to obtain filters between the boxcar
    filter, which is optimal in the case of AWGN; and the raised cosine filter
    which has the narrowest frequency response without ISI.

    '''Return a receive filter designed to minimize ISI.

    `phases=1` returns an ordinary filter. Higher numbers interpolate the
    filter for polyphase clock recovery, etc.

    PSK31 transmits symbols with a raised cosine pulse shape. Note this
    isn't a raised-cosine filter: it's a raised cosine impulse.

    While more reasonable PSK transmissions use (almost always) a
    root-raised-cosine (that's a raised cosine in the frequency domain)
    filter so the matched filter is zero-ISI, PSK31's transmit filter
    means a matched filter in the receiver would have severe ISI.

    The raised cosine pulse shape also has an infinitely wide frequency
    response, no matter how ideally the filter is realized. For the typical
    case of many PSK31 signals all crammed into one 3kHz channel, this is
    unfortunate.

    This is a compromise filter which attempts to maximize:

    - capturing the maximum transmitted energy
    - minimizing ISI
    - a narrow passband to reject adjacent interfering signals

    This filter was developed using the highly advanced method of manually
    twiddling the cutoff and transition parameters until it looked good. A
    Hann windowed sinc filter seems to perform especially well, probably on
    account of the Hann function being a raised cosine, though a rigorous
    analysis has not been made.

    The captured signal energy is 0.23 dB below the matched filter case. A
    cursory estimation puts ISI on par with `pskcore_filter_taps`.
